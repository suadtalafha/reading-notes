# AWS: Events
Review, Research, and Discussion
1. Describe the similarities between AWS API Gateway + Lambda functions and an ExpressJS Server

AWS API Gateway and Lambda functions together can work almost exactly like an express server. In an express server, you make routes and then you fire them with functions. In AWS, you make routes in API Gateway and they trigger a Lambda function to run

2. List the AWS Database offerings and talk about the pros and cons of each

Database offerings can be found here (Links to an external site.). There is an excellent table under the Database services section that lists the Database types, their use cases, and the AWS services that offer those database types. Types include Relational, key-value, in memory, Document, Wide column, graph, time series, and ledger

3. What’s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?

A FIFO queue is first in, first out. A standard queue is more randomized, but guarantees that an item is only ‘delivered’ once, meaning if an item leaves the queue it is now gone from the queue.

4. How can the server be assured a message was properly received?

It returns a 200 status

## What’s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
Standard queues guarantee that a message is delivered at least once and duplicates can be introduced into the queue. FIFO queues ensure a message is delivered exactly once and remains available until a consumer processes and deletes it
How can the server be assured a message was properly received?
to get a response from the client that the message was received
Document the following Vocabulary Terms
Serverless API: a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers.

Triggers: resource in another service that you configure to invoke your function in response to lifecycle events

* *Dynamo vs Mongo: DynamoDB is a fully managed solution. Using a fully managed service reduces the amount of time a team spends on operations; (no pager duty alerts), no servers to update, kernel patches to roll out, SSDs to replace, hardware provisioning, setup/configuration, throughput capacity planning, replication, software patching, or cluster scaling. The focus shifts to application logic where the real value lies. The general rule of thumb is to choose Dynamo for low throughput apps as writes are expensive and consistent reads are twice the cost of eventually consistent reads. MongoDB’s Atlas cost comes from infrastructure availability and backups for external managed services; throughput is inclusive of the pricing*

Dynamoose vs Mongoose

Dynamoose is a modeling tool for Amazon’s DynamoDB

Mongoose is mongodb object modeling for node.js
