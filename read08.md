# Comparision operation 
## Evaluation conditions 

** You can evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the script to what you expect it might be. **

** *( The result will be boolean : True \ False ) * **


| == | != | === |!==
|-------------------------------------------------|------------| -----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| ** Is equal to ** | ** Is not equal to ** | ** Strict equal to ** |** Strict not equal to ** |
 |** The operator compares two values or booleans to see if they are in same ** | ** The operator compares two values or booleans to see if they are not in same ** | ** compare valuse and check data type are same  ** | ** compare valuse and check data type are same ** |

 # Logical Operator

## Comparision operator usually return single valuse of  * True * or * False *

|** && ** | ** Or ** |** ! ** |
|-------------------| ----------------- | ----------|
|** Test more than one condition **| ** Test at least one condition **| ** Takes a single boolean value and invert it ** |

# Loops 
### Check a condition if it returns true , a code block will run . Then the condition will be checked again and if it still returns true . It repeats until the condition returns false . 
 
 | ** For ** | ** While ** | ** Do while ** |
 | ----------------------------- | ------------------- | -----------------|
 | ** Run code a spacific number of time ** | ** If you don't know how many times the code should run ** | ** Simillar to while but it will run the ststment insid the curly braces at least once , even the condition false ** |
