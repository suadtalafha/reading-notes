# Describe use cases useState() vs useReducer()
useState is a Basic Hook for managing simple state transformation and useReducer is an Additional Hook for managing more complex state logic, it is worth noting that useState uses the useReducer internally. This implies that you could use useReducer for everything you can do with useState.

useReducer is usually preferable to useState when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one. useReducer also lets you optimize performance for components that trigger deep updates because you can pass dispatch down instead of callbacks.

* Why do custom hooks need the use prefix?
Custom hooks are normal JS functions, named with the prefix ‘use’, that can use hooks inside of it and contain a common stateful logic to be reused in other components.

* What do custom hooks usually do?
Custom hooks allow us to have cleaner functional components, remove logic from the UI layer, and prevent code duplication by bringing common use cases to reusable hooks.

Using any list of custom hooks, research and name one that you think will be useful in your applications
useClippy A hook for copying data to the clipboard and retrieving/pasting it using Ctrl-C/Command-C and Ctrl-V/Command-V.

useBrowserContextCommunication useBrowserContextCommunication uses the Broadcast Channel API to deliver an easy solution for communication between different browser contexts (tabs, iframes, windows).

useScript useScript is a hook for loading (and notifying when they’re loaded) external scripts, dynamically.

Describe how a hook that fetches API data might work
First, we’re going to import stuff we’re going to use and create a function. The next step is to add a useState hook and to define the name of the state - in our case, that’s data. Then, we define the function we’ll use later on to update the state - setData. In the end, we set the initial value of our state, which is null</strong in our case.

fter adding our useState hook to handle the data, the next step is to make the fetch request.

First, we’re going to create a constant fetchURL, in case we need to reuse our endpoint to fetch other data, except for posts. You can check here what else you can fetch and play with.
