# Login and Auth
* Why is the Context API useful?

Because it’s enables you to exchange unique details and assists in solving prop-drilling from all levels of your application.
Can a component outside of a provider get its context?

Yes we can call useContext in each component to pull out the values we need. It doesn’t matter how far apart the components are as long as they’re wrapped in a provider.
What are some common use cases for using the Context API?

Some sample use cases where the Context API proves helpful are:
Theming — Pass down app themei
18n — Pass down translation messages
Authentication — Pass down current authenticated user
Describe “Context Hell”

the React Context hell is the nasty code you get taking advantage of the React Context API.

How to fix it?

To clean up the nasty code you get from taking advantage of React Context API we need a way to nest multiple Context.Provider without passing them as children of each other.

To achieve that we can use the React.cloneElement API.

The cloneElement API

# Terms
global state: a global state is a set of local states which are all concurrent with each other

global context: it’s designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user, theme, or preferred language.

* what is role based access control?
Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts network access based on a person’s role within an organization and has become one of the main methods for advanced access control.

Some of the designations in an RBAC tool can include:

Management role scope – it limits what objects the role group is allowed to manage.
Management role group – you can add and remove members.
Management role – these are the types of tasks that can be performed by a specific role group.
Management role assignment – this links a role to a role group.
react-cookies component

Cookies are the data stored in the form of key-value pairs that are used to store information about the user on their computer by the websites that the users browse and use it to verify them.

To set or remove the cookies, we are going to use a third-party dependency of react-cookie.
