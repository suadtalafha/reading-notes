## The introduction in JAVAScript 


- **  A Script : is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one by one . **

* ** The comment is to explain what the code does . **

* ** Variable : place to store data temporilly . **

* ** Before use a variable , you need to announce that you want to use it . **

* ** JavaScript make your web page more interactive by accessing and modifing content .**

* ** JAVASCRIPT IS CASE SENSITIVE
JavaScript is case sensitive so hourNow means
something different to HourNow or HOURNOW.**

## EXAMPLES OF JAVASCRIPT IN THE BROWSER





Being able to change the content of an HTML page while it is loaded in
the browser is very powerful. The examples below rely on the ability to:

Access the content of the page
Modify the content of the page
Program rules or instructions the browser can follow
React to events triggered by the user or browser .

# OPERATORS

## Expressions rely on things called *operators*; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.

* JavaScript contains the following mathematical
operators, which you can use with numbers.
You may remember some from math class.



### STRING OPERATOR
There is just one string operator: the+ symbol.
It is used to join the strings on either side of it.

## WHAT IS A FUNCTION?
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements).
