# Summary 
## Dicision and loops

* Conditional statements allow your code to make
decisions about what to do next.
* Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>)
are used to compare two operands.
* Logical operators allow you to combine more than one
set of comparison operators.
* if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code
if a condition is true, and another if it is false.
switch statements allow you to compare a value
against possible outcomes (and also provides a default
option if none match).
* Data types can be coerced from one type to another.
* All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.
* There are three types of loop: for, while, and
do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
