# Summary
## Layout

* <div> elements are often used as containing elements
to group together sections of a page.


* Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.


* The float property moves content to the left or right
of the page and can be used to create multi-column
layouts. 
* (Floated items require a defined width.)

* Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
* Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).

* Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
* CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
* You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
