# AWS: Cloud Servers

1-Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle

2-The request/response cycle traces how a user's request flows through the app. Understanding the request/response cycle is helpful to figure out which files to edit when developing an app (and where to look when things aren't working).

Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC
All resources are hosted on a server. The server’s location on the web can be identified by its IP address, however, IP addresses aren’t particularly user friendly, and instead we use URLS (such as http://www.google.co.uk (Links to an external site.)) to search for a resource. Once the client’s request has reached the server, the server will search for and return the information the client is requesting. Often times, this means querying a database, loading the information into an html page, and returning the HTML text to the user in the body of the HTTP response.

3-What does it mean to “deploy” an application?
Software deployment refers to the process of running an application on a server or device.

Server - A server is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network.

Pub/Sub - Pub/Sub enables you to create systems of event producers and consumers, called publishers and subscribers

WRRC - The web is a cycle of requests and responses that flow between clients and servers.
