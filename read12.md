# Regular Expressions!

* Search for particular items within a large body of text. eg. You may wish to identify all email addresses in some content using a text editor.


* Replace particular items. eg. You may wish to clean up some poorly formatted HTML by replacing all uppercase tags with lowercase equivalents in a text editor.


* Validate input. eg. You may want to check that a password meets certain criteria such as, a mix of uppercase and lowercase, digits and punctuation etc in a program you are writing.


* Coordinate actions. eg. You may wish to process certain files in a directory, but only if they meet particular conditions, in work you are doing on the command line.


* Reformat text. eg. You may export data from one program as a text file then modify its layout so you may import it into another program using a text editor.

## *So Where and How do I use Regular Expressions?*

* Regular expressions are a feature of many pieces of software and nearly all programming languages .

#### Learning Regular Expressions
* Break the regular expression down into it's individual components (So for instance, in the regular expression example above it would become b and [ia]).

* Speak out aloud the steps of the expression. So for the above expression I might say: "First it matches a b, followed by either an i or an a" (This step may sound silly but trust me it works. You use different parts of your brain when you speak as opposed to think internally.)

* Build the regular expression incrementally, testing as you go.

# Summury

### Basic Navigation!

**pwd**
* Print Working Directory - ie. Where are we currently.
**ls**
* List the contents of a directory.
**cd**
* Change Directories - ie. move to another directory.
**Relative path**
* A file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system.
Absolute path
A file or directory location in relation to the root of the file system.

# More About Files! 


### Linux is an Extensionless System

**The following are common extensions:**

* file.exe - an executable file, or program.
* file.txt - a plain text file.
* file.png, file.gif, file.jpg - an image.


### Linux is Case Sensitive
This is very important and a common source of problems for people new to Linux.

### Spaces in names

*A space on the command line is how we seperate items.*

**file**
obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is.
**ls -a**
List the contents of a directory, including hidden files.
Everything is a file under Linux
Even directories.
Linux is an extensionless system
Files can have any extension they like or none at all.
Linux is case sensitive
Beware of silly typos.
