# Context API - Behaviors

* When you have multiple contexts, what component type should you use (class/function) and why?

Class components, the render method will be called, whenever the state of the components changes. On the other hand, the Functional components render the UI based on the props. Class Components should be preferred whenever we have the requirement with the state of the component.
What are some good use cases for using the Context API for global state?

* when some data needs to be accessible by many components at different nesting levels.
How can you best test context?

The best way to test Context is to make our tests unaware of its existence and avoiding mocks
Terms
context: is related to objects. It refers to the object to which a function belongs. When you use the JavaScript “this” keyword, it refers to the object to which function belongs.

useContext: hook is used to create common data that can be accessed throughout the component hierarchy without passing the props down manually to each level.

Static context: A static method or, block belongs to the class and these will be loaded into the memory along with the class. You can invoke static methods without creating an object.
