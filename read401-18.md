# AWS: S3 and Lambda

* Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. This means customers of all sizes and industries can use it to store and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases, such as data lakes, websites, mobile applications, backup and restore, archive, enterprise applications, IoT devices, and big data analytics. Amazon S3 provides easy-to-use management features so you can organize your data and configure finely-tuned access controls to meet your specific business, organizational, and compliance requirements.

AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Users of AWS Lambda create functions, self-contained applications written in one of the supported languages and runtimes, and upload them to AWS Lambda, which executes those functions in an efficient and flexible manner.

### Describe “The Cloud”
it’s a term used describe a global network of servers, each with a unique function. The cloud is not a physical entity, but instead is a vast network of remote servers around the globe which are hooked together and meant to operate as a single ecosystem.
What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?
A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.
What is auto-scaling?
Auto Scaling lets you build scaling plans that automate how groups of different resources respond to changes in demand.

Auto Scaling allows your application to always have the compute capacity needed and reduces the need to manually monitor server capacity.

## What is bandwidth?
Bandwidth is the maximum rate of data transfer across a given path. Bandwidth may be characterized as network bandwidth, data bandwidth, or digital bandwidth.

Bandwidth is a measure of how much information a network, a group of two or more devices that communicate between themselves, can transfer.

### How do cloud providers compute service costs?
cloud providers determine the expense to maintaining the network. They start by calculating costs for network hardware, network infrastructure maintenance, and labor. These expenses are added together and then divided by the number of rack units a business will need for its IaaS cloud.
Document the following Vocabulary Terms
Server Instances: is a single copy of the software running on a single physical or virtual server.

Containers: A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

Cloud Services: a wide range of services delivered on demand to companies and customers over the internet. These services are designed to provide easy, affordable access to applications and resources, without the need for internal infrastructure or hardware.

Cloud Architecture: the technology components that are combined to build a cloud, where resources are pooled through virtualization technology and shared across a network.

AWS: Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform.

EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku:

AWS Elastic Beanstalk is well suited for the rapid development of applications that use standard compute platforms based on popular programming languages. So getting a Go, Python, Ruby, or Node.js app going in AWS Elastic Beanstalk will be easy. For non-standard applications, containers provide another option for using AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

Heroku is very well suited for startups looking to get a server stack up and running quickly. There is little to no overhead when managing your instances. However, you’ll need a background in basic DevOps or system management to make sure everything is set up correctly. In addition, it’s easy to accidentally go crazy on pricing. Make sure you’re only creating the server instances you need to run the base application and set up an auto-scaler plugin to handle peaks
