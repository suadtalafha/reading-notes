# How computer work : Binary and Data

 ## Computer work on ones and zeroes ( 0 / 1)
  
   ** Insid computer wires and circuits carry all the informations in computer. **

   ## How do we store or represent informations using electricity ?

   The single wire can be : 
   * on / off .
   * yse / no .
   * 1 /0 .
   * True / false .
   
   ### - With bits we can represent complex informations
   
   ** Decimal system (9 digits ) ** 
   ** Binary (0/1 ) **
    ** The larger wire means larger informations to store **

# How computer work : Circuits and lOgic

### Every input and output is type of information ca be presented in on / off electrical signals(0/1) .

 * we use circuits to mdified and combiend input signals and flips it .

 * Complicated circuits take multiple signals and combined them to give different outputs .
