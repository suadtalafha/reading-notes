3- Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js 1 Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?

1- Swagger status Codes:

200 : Successful request and response.
400 : Bad request
404 : Not found
500 : Unexpected error

apiDocjs: Inline Documentation for RESTful web APIs, It creates a documentation from API annotations in your source code. It includes a default template which uses handlebars, Bootstrap, RequireJS and jQuery for the output of the generated apidata.js and apiproject.js as a html-page

Swagger: It is a free cloud-based API testing and documentation tool to simplify the validation of any API and generate its corresponding OpenAPI documentation.
