# Nosql vs Sql

### SQL
table based databases	
have predefined schema	
vertically scalable	
uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data	
not best fit for hierarchical data storage	

### NoSQL:
document based, key-value pairs, graph databases
have dynamic schema.
horizontally scalable.
uses UnQL (Unstructured Query Language)
fits better for the hierarchical data storage.


1-What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment.

2-Give a real world example.

Memcached as a NoSQL API to MySQL: Memcached can be used to increase the performance of the data retrieval operations giving an advantage of NoSQL api to MySQL server.

3-What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

Document based, key-value pairs, graph databases

4-Give a real world example.

MongoDB

5-Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

NoSQL database

6-Which type of database is best for scalability?

SQL database

SQL VS NOSQL
1-What does SQL stand for?

Structured Query Language.

2-What is a realational database?

It’s a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.

3-What type of structure does a relational database work with?

Works with tables.

4-What is a ‘schema’?

The term "schema" refers to the organization of data as a blueprint of how the database is constructed

5-What is a NoSQL database?

An approach to database design that provides flexible schemas for the storage and retrieval of data beyond the traditional table structures found in relational databases.

6-Howo does it work?

We have databases just like SQL, but it’s dynamic, which means it’s not a table database but collections that contain documents.

7-What is inside of a Mongo database?

We have collections instead of tables, and inside collections we have documents.

8-Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

MongoDB, because it has no specific schema. Also, there are no relations

9-What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

when you want to update a spcific data, you have to update all collections that contain that data.
