# Summary
## Forms

* Whenever you want to c XX ollect information from
visitors you will need a form, which lives inside a
`<form>` element.


* Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs.

* Each form control is given a name, and the text the
user types in or the values of the options they select
are sent to the server.
* HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it
easier for visitors to fill in forms.

# Summary
## Tables& Forms

* In addition to the CSS  properties covered in other
chapters which work with the contents of all elements,
there are several others that are specifically used to
control the appearance of lists, tables, and forms.

* List markers can be given different appearances
using the list-style-type and list-style image
properties.

* Table cells can have different borders and spacing in
different browsers, but there are properties you can
use to control them and make them more consistent.

* Forms are easier to use if the form controls are
vertically aligned using CSS.

* Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more
interactive.

# Summary 
## Document object model

* The browser represents the page using a DOM tree.
DOM trees have four types of nodes: document nodes,
element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes.

* You can select element nodes by their id or cl ass
attributes, by tag name, or using CSS selector syntax.

* Whenever a DOM query can return more than one
node, it will always return a Nadel i st.

* From an element node, you can access and update its
content using properties such as textContent and
i nnerHTML or using DOM manipulation techniques.

* An element node can contain multiple text nodes and
child elements that are siblings of each other.

* In older browsers, implementation of the DOM is
inconsistent (and is a popular reason for using jQuery).
Browsers offer tools for viewing the DOM tree .
