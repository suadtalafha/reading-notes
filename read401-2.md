# Review, Research, and Discussion

### Describe (in plain English) what Array.map() does

Array.Map() is used to create a new array by calling a function on each element of the passed array.
&
will always return you a new array of the same length as the original array comprised of your return values .

### Describe (in plain English) what Array.reduce() does

The reduce() method executes a reducer function (that you provide) on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value .

### Provide code snippets showing how to use superagent() to fetch data from a URL and log the result

With normal Promise .then() syntax

superagent.get(url).then(reult=>{consle.log(result)}.catch(err=>{consle.log(err)}

Again with async / await syntax

let getData=async()=>{ let data=await superagent.get(url)consle.log(data.body)}; grtData();

### Explain promises as though you were mentoring a Code 301 level student

In java script the code run line by line (in order) and if there any function will take time the java script will skip it so for that we use promises we say to java script please finish this function i will wait and then you can go to the other lines

### Are all callback functions considered to be Asynchronous? Why or Why Not?

no, not always callback functions considered to be Asynchronous, Every asynchronous function takes a function argument, but not every function that does so is asynchronous.
