 # Summary
 ## Tables 
  
 * The <table> element is used to add tables to a web
page.
* A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created
with the <tr> element.
* Inside each row there are a number of cells
represented by the <td> element (or <th> if it is a
header).
* You can make cells of a table span more than one row
or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.
* For long tables you can split the table into a <thead>,
<tbody>, and <tfoot>.

# Summary
## Objects & Functions

* Functions allow you to group a set of related
statements together that represent a single task.
* Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required
to do their job) and may return a value.
* An object is a series of variables and functions that
represent something from the world around you.
* In an object, variables are known as properties of the
object; functions are known as methods of the object.
Web browsers implement objects that represent both
the browser window and the document loaded into the
browser window.
* JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as
String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and
methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.
* Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data
sets (and both can contain the other).
