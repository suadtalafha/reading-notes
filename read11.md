## What is CSS ?
***CSS allows you to create rules that control the
way that each individual box (and the contents
of that box) is presented.***

*Using CSS, you could add a
border around any of the boxes,
specify its width and height, or
add a background color. You
could also control text inside
a box â€” for example, its color,
size, and the typeface used.

## CSS Properties Affect How Elements Are Displayed

**CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two
parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify
several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.**
