# Summary
## TEXT 

* HTML elements are used t XX o describe the structure of
the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).
* They also provide semantic information (e.g. where
emphasis should be placed, the definition of any
acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).

# Summary

* There are properties to control t XX he choice of font, size,
weight, style, and spacing.
* There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume
most people will have installed.
* If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are
several options, but you need to have the right license
to use them.
* You can control the space between lines of text,
individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned
to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be
indented.
* You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an
element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or
when they have visited a link.

# Summary
## Javascript instructions

* A script is made up of a series of statements. Each
statement is like a step in a recipe.
* Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example,
you might specify that a value must be remembered
before creating a calculation using that value.
* Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of
information used in the script.
* Arrays are special types of variables that store more
than one piece of related information.
* JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9),
strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
* Expressions evaluate into a single value.
* Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.

# Summary 
## Dicision and loops

* Conditional statements allow your code to make
decisions about what to do next.
* Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>)
are used to compare two operands.
* Logical operators allow you to combine more than one
set of comparison operators.
* if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code
if a condition is true, and another if it is false.
switch statements allow you to compare a value
against possible outcomes (and also provides a default
option if none match).
* Data types can be coerced from one type to another.
* All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.
* There are three types of loop: for, while, and
do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
